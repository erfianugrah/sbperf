 * findings and the narrate evidence digest count the SAME objects the advisor
 * does: we never flag a Supabase-managed index (e.g. an `auth` internal index)
 * and never miss a custom application schema (e.g. `cs2a`). The previous
 * heuristic - `schema === "public"` - silently under-reported every project
 * that keeps its tables outside `public`.
 *
 * Keep in sync with the schema denylist in src/splinter.sql. A schema that is
 * unknown here is treated as an application schema (fail-open), so a new
 * user schema is never silently dropped.
